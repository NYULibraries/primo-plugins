Primo plugins are hooks into Primo to extend functionality.  Currently
NYU has one only implemented Primo enrichment plugin that adds OCLC IDs 
into the Primo document based on a mapping from Aleph bibliographic system 
numbers (BSNs) stored in the NYU Libraries' Aleph DataWarehouse.

In order to build a jar, the META-INF/datawarehouse.properties file must 
be configured.  A sample properties files is included at 
META-INF/datawarehouse.properties.tml. After configuring the DataWarehouse 
properties ant can be run to create the jar. The jar is now in the dist 
directory.
