Primo plugins are hooks into Primo to extend functionality.  Currently
we have only one Primo enrichment plugin built that adds OCLC IDs into
the Primo document based on a mapping of Aleph bibliographic
system numbers (BSNs) from the NYU Libraries' Aleph DataWarehouse.

In order to build a jar, you must first configure the
META-INF/datawarehouse.properties file.  A sample 
properties files is included at META-INF/datawarehouse.properties.tml.
After configuring the DataWarehouse properties you can then run ant to
create the jar. 
  shell$ ant
Your jar is now in the dist directory.
